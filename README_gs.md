# Gstore System

Gstore System(also called gStore) is a graph database engine for managing large graph-structured data, which is open-source and targets at Linux operation systems. The whole project is written in C++, with the help of some libraries such as readline, antlr, and so on. Only source tarballs are provided currently, which means you have to compile the source code if you want to use our system.

**The formal help document is in [English(EN)](docs/help/gStore_help.pdf) and [中文(CN)](docs/help/gStore_help_CN.pdf).**

**The formal experiment result is in [Experiment](docs/test/formal_experiment.pdf).**

**We have built an IRC channel named #gStore on freenode, and you can also come to our website: [gStore](http://gstore-pku.com).**

## Getting Started

This system is really user-friendly and you can pick it up in several minutes. Remember to check your platform where you want to run this system by viewing [System Requirements](docs/DEMAND.md). After all are verified, please get this project's source code. There are several ways to do this:

- download the zip from this repository and extract it

- fork this repository in your github account

- type `git clone https://github.com/Caesar11/gStore.git` in your terminal or use git GUI to acquire it

Then you need to compile the project, just type `make` in the gStore root directory, and all executables will be ok. To run gStore, please type `bin/gbuild database_name dataset_path` to build a database named by yourself. And you can use `bin/gquery database_name` command to query a existing database. What is more, `bin/ghttp` is a wonderful tool designed for you, as a database server which can be visited via HTTP protocol. Notice that all commands should be typed in the root directory of gStore, and your database name should not end with ".db".

There are some restrictions when you use the current gStore project, you can see them on [Limit Description](docs/LIMIT.md).

Sometimes you may find some strange phenomena(but not wrong case), or something hard to understand/solve(don't know how to do next), then do not hesitate to visit the [Frequently Asked Questions](docs/FAQ.md) page.

Graph database engine is a new area and we are still trying to go further. Things we plan to do next is in [Future Plan](docs/PLAN.md) chapter, and we hope more and more people will support or even join us. You can support in many ways:

- watch/star our project

- fork this repository and submit pull requests to us

- download and use this system, report bugs or suggestions

- ...

People who inspire us or contribute to this project will be listed in the [Thanks List](docs/THANK.md) chapter.
